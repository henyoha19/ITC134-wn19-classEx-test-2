This is a mystery story with an undercurrent about hate and the dangers of small-mindedness. The story is about a posturing philosopher. It starts in a town. A terrible monster and the need to stop it is a major element of the story.

The collage professor found a magic hat, that makes me understand github branching and merging. Sadly, when i take off i forget everything.
